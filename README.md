# Front-end coding test

## Overview

Here at Firefly, we like modular, composable code. That's true right across our HTML, CSS and Javascript. This test is designed around a typical problem we encounter, namely creating stand-alone front-end components that can be reused in a number of contexts.

We've provided a design and HTML for an example component that we'd like you to use to demonstrate your styling skills. This design shows a component, shown at different widths and in different states.


**To start this test, you'll need to clone or [download the zip](https://github.com/fireflylearning/front-end-coding-test-css/archive/master.zip) of this repository**.

### Time

This test should take you around two hours.

### Environment

Set this up however you feel comfortable!

## Part 1: HTML and CSS

We’ve provided a HTML file for you. However, we’re not sure how well its been put together! 

We’d like you to:

1. **Rewrite the HTML and fix whatever problems you see.**
2. **Create the CSS for the component.**

We’d like you to consider:

* Accessibility
* BEM class structure
* Compatibility with older browsers (IE10 +)
* Progressive Enhancement
* Performance
* Mobile First
* Modularity (particularly in your CSS)
* New CSS techniques, while keeping in mind progressive enhancement

For this part of the task, don’t worry about adding JS to enhance the functionality.

## Part 2: Javascript

We’d like you to make the component function. However you wish to do this is fine: Direct DOM manipulation with Vanilla JS, or jQuery is acceptable. We use React for this kind of thing, so bonus points if you do that. What we’re looking for is approach, rather than amazing code.

## When you’ve finished

Please bring your final code with you to your interview where we’ll discuss your approach.
